This is our project, Nutribuns, which aims to use tweets from the recent years to identify the common theme behind online misinformation regarding the food during the Ferdinand Marcos' regime. During the Ferdinand Marcos regime in the Philippines, a period marked by political turmoil and controversial policies, the manipulation of information played a significant role in shaping public opinion. One area that witnessed the impact of misinformation was the food situation in the country. In this data science study, we delve into the collection and analysis of fake news tweets pertaining to the food crisis during Marcos' reign. By examining these tweets, we aim to shed light on the prevalence and nature of disinformation surrounding the food situation, uncover the potential sources and motives behind such falsehoods, and contribute to a better understanding of the intersection between propaganda, social media, and historical events.

This project aims to analyze recent tweets to identify the prevalent theme of online misinformation about food during the Ferdinand Marcos' regime, specifically focusing on food prices. By studying these unreliable sources from Twitter, the researchers intend to gain insights that will facilitate the identification of such misinformation amidst the vast amount of disinformation present on the internet.
