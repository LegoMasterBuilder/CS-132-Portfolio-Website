					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				</header>

				<p>The findings suggest that the main argument of tweets spreading misinformation on the food situation during the Ferdinand Marcos' Regime is <strong>multifaceted</strong>. While some tweets highlight positive views of food programs and policies under Marcos, others focus on concerns about poverty, malnutrition, and the discontinuation of certain projects. Hence, it can be inferred that the above mentioned tweets were not primarily focused on claiming that food prices were cheaper during that era. Overall, the analysis of the tweet clusters suggests that while there were various arguments made regarding the food situation during the Marcos regime, they encompassed a wider range of topics beyond just the affordability of food. The diverse range of discussions and perspectives found in this project thus highlights the need for consideration of multiple viewpoints when assessing historical events and their associated narratives.</p>

					<h2>Implications</h2>
				</header>
                <p>Identifying the main arguments of misinformation allows fact-checkers and researchers to focus their efforts on debunking specific claims and providing accurate information to counteract the spread of false narratives. Correspondingly, the findings could then be used to contribute to informed discussions and debates about the Marcos regime, its impact on the food situation, and the spread of misinformation related to it.</p>
				<p>With regards to practical applications, a possible application of this study would be using it as a reliable source for journalism and media coverage. Journalists can utilize these findings to uncover and address the narratives propagated through social media, contributing to more accurate and nuanced reporting on historical events and their implications. This research can also serve as a reference point for further investigation into the different false narratives surrounding the Marcos era. Furthermore, researchers can use this as a guide in examining the impact of misinformation on public perception and further promote the spread of accurate information.</p>
