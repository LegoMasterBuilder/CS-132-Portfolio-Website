				<p>It is important to note that cluster 13, which talks about the economic situation and price control 
					efforts during the Marcos era, is the cluster that is most in line with the topic of food prices 
					and our problem statement.</p>

					<h2>What did we find out? What are our key takeaways?</h2>
				</header>

				<p>The clustering analysis of the tweets using LDA revealed 13 distinct clusters with varying frequencies. 
					Both Cluster 3 and Cluster 5 emerged as the largest clusters (19 tweets).
					The tweets in these clusters indicated positive sentiments and nostalgic associations with the Marcos 
					regime and also mentioned the loss of the nutribun and milk programs. On the other hand, the rest of 
					the clusters had relatively fewer tweets (4-15 tweets). These clusters covered a wide range of topics,
					 including personal experiences, political figures, poverty, and food programs.</p>
				
                <header>
					<h2>Why should you care about our findings?</h2>
				</header>
                <p>By analyzing the main arguments of tweets spreading misinformation about the food situation during the 
					Marcos regime, it sheds light on the narrative that is being propagated and its potential impact on public 
					perception. Misinformation can distort historical events and lead to misunderstandings, reinforcing false 
					beliefs or narratives. Therefore, by identifying the main arguments used in spreading misinformation about 
					the food situation during the Marcos regime, these findings can aid in developing strategies to counter and 
					debunk false narratives. This will also contribute to promoting accurate historical knowledge and preventing 
					further spread of misinformation.</p>

				<header>
					<h2>How do our findings fit into what you already know?</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The emergence of Clusters 3 and 5, which talks about positive sentiments and nostalgic associations with the Marcos 
					regime as well as the disappearance of the nutribun and milk programs, aligns with previous knowledge about certain 
					segments of the population holding favorable views of that era. While these specific arguments towards the Marcos 
					regime have shown to be prevalent in this analysis, it also shows that the spread of misinformation about the food 
					situation is not solely focused on claims of cheaper food prices. Instead, a diverse range of topics, including talks 
					of personal experiences, politics, malnutrition, and food programs, are encompassed within the identified clusters. 
					This expands our understanding of the narratives surrounding the Marcos era and how they relate to the food situation.</p>
