				<p>The clustering analysis of the tweets using LDA revealed 13 distinct clusters with varying frequencies. Both Cluster 3 and Cluster 5 emerged as the largest clusters (19 tweets). The tweets in these clusters indicated positive sentiments and nostalgic associations with the Marcos regime and also mentioned the loss of the nutribun and milk programs. On the other hand, the rest of the clusters had relatively fewer tweets (4-15 tweets). These clusters covered a wide range of topics, including personal experiences, political figures, poverty, and food programs.</p>

					<h2>Why should we care about your findings? </h2>

                <p>By analyzing the main arguments of tweets spreading misinformation about the food situation during the Marcos regime, it sheds light on the narrative that is being propagated and its potential impact on public perception. Misinformation can distort historical events and lead to misunderstandings, reinforcing false beliefs or narratives. Therefore, by identifying the main arguments used in spreading misinformation about the food situation during the Marcos regime, these findings can aid in developing strategies to counter and debunk false narratives. This will also contribute to promoting accurate historical knowledge and preventing further spread of misinformation.</p>
